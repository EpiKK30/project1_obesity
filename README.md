## Obesity Project – Group 2.
### Project Overview

This repository contains materials for the Obesity Project conducted by our team on April 14, 2024. Our project aims to explore primary risk factors associated with obesity by analyzing available datasets. We examine demographic, dietary, and lifestyle factors to inform preventive interventions and health policy.

  5.	Kevin Ngala
### Research Questions
The project aimed to identify primary risk factors associated with obesity through the analysis of available datasets, focusing on the following research questions:
  1.	What is the association between dietary habits and the risk of obesity?
  2.	Is there a significant relationship between smoking, alcohol consumption, and the risk of obesity?
  3.	What is the association between physical activity levels and the risk of obesity?

### Dataset Description
  1.	The dataset presents estimations of obesity prevalence among individuals aged 14 to 61 from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, reflecting diverse dietary patterns and physical statuses. 
  2.	These estimations were derived from a web-based survey, yielding a dataset comprising 17 attributes and 2111 records. 
  3.	The dataset comprises numeric and continuous data suitable for epidemiological analyses, including classification, prediction, segmentation, and association studies.
  4.	Notably, no instances of missing or duplicate data were identified across the dataset columns.

### Attributes:
  #### Eating Habits:
    1.	Frequent consumption of high-caloric food (FAVC)
    2.	Frequency of consumption of vegetables (FCVC)
    3.	Number of main meals (NCP)
    4.	Consumption of food between meals (CAEC)
    5.	Consumption of water daily (CH20)
    6.	Consumption of alcohol (CALC)

  #### Physical Condition:
    1.	Calories consumption monitoring (SCC)
    2.	Physical activity frequency (FAF)
    3.	Time using technology devices (TUE)
    4.	Transportation used (MTRANS)

  #### Independent Variables:
    1.	Gender
    2.	Age
    3.	Height
    4.	Weight

  #### Obesity Levels:
    1.	Underweight: Less than 18.5
    2.	Normal: 18.5 to 24.9
    3.	Overweight: 25.0 to 29.9
    4.	Obesity I: 30.0 to 34.9
    5.	Obesity II: 35.0 to 39.9
    6.	Obesity III: Higher than 40

### Exploratory Data Analysis
After cleaning the data, completing data exploration, and conducting descriptive statistics, we reclassified the "Weight classification" column and subset the "obesity" category to conduct the analysis.

1.	Gender
2.	Age
3.	Height(m)
4.	Weight(kg)
5.	Fhx of Overweight
6.	Freq High Calorie Cons
7.	Freq vegetable cons
8.	Number of Main Meals
9.	Eating inbetween meals
10.	Hx of smoking
11.	Water consumption
12.	Calorie Consumption Monitoring
13.	Freq of Physical Activity
14.	Time spent on Tech devices
15.	Alcohol consumption
16.	Transportation used
17.	Weight group
18.	BMI
19.	Weight classification

Key findings will be summarized in a write-up, highlighting significant relationships between variables and obesity rates. 
Visualizations will be provided to illustrate these relationships effectively.
